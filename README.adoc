= BASH Special Parameters

A BASH script for quickly demonstrating how special parameters <<bm>>  work.

== Usage

This script is intended to run in BASH although it should work with other POSIX compatable shells. It works best when it is provided with a few arguments.

It can be run with the shell itself:

[source,shell]
----
$ bash special-params abc 123 4 5 6
----

Or make the script executable then run it:

[source,shell]
----
$ chmod +x special-params 
$ ./special-params
----
